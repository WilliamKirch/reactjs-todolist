Following the 'Roadmap - Learn to Code' from @Smoljames this is the 2nd project that we have created barring the 'SPA' which I am waiting to deploy till after I am fully done the roadmap and have made more adjustments to the page. 

Ive taken the past 2 days to complete the JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures course (which I probably could have been adding the code from that onto my github but we'll ignore that). Hoping to spend a few more hours today working on
  the next part of learning JavaScript frameworks by working on a GYM App using ReactJS!
